# Pothole Reporting System — Django backend and recording experiment

Computer vision final-year project for Biratnagar International College, Nepal.

The [proposal-aligned scope and milestones](docs/proposal-alignment.md) describe the intended Android Expo collector, Django/DRF processing workflow, reviewed hazards and alerts. The current iPhone browser recorder is a feasibility experiment, not the proposed Android app.

## What works now

The backend is moving from FastAPI to Django in small lessons. [Django lesson 1](docs/django-step-1.md) adds `GET /` and `GET /health/` on local port 8003. [Django lesson 2](docs/django-step-2.md) connects it to PostgreSQL through `GET /health/database/`. [Django lesson 3](docs/django-step-3.md) creates a private `CaptureSession` table, [lesson 4](docs/django-step-4.md) adds timestamped GPS readings, and [lesson 6](docs/django-step-6.md) adds an authenticated, owner-only JSON API for session metadata. No video/GPS upload or public-report endpoint exists yet. The previously tested FastAPI server remains available on port 8001 for the phone recording experiment while that route is migrated. See [database setup](docs/database-setup.md).

The recording page captures a short video and timestamped browser location readings, then offers two local downloads. The user confirmed iPhone camera/location access, MP4 playback both on the page and after downloading to Files, and recording stopping with an interruption message when leaving Safari. Two real iPhone exports passed the local checker's timing-consistency and video filename, size and header checks. The outdoor test still had a 4.45-second initial location gap; exact video/location alignment and road-position accuracy remain unverified. Android device testing is pending. The recorder prefers H.264/MP4 when supported. Detection, uploads, database storage and the map are still future milestones.

## Run on Windows (PowerShell)

The existing virtual environment in this workspace is named `.pothholevenv` (with an extra `h`), and was created with Python 3.13. The commands below use that exact name. A virtual environment keeps this project's Python packages separate from other projects. Both `.pothholevenv/` and `.potholevenv/` are excluded from Git.

Open PowerShell in the project folder. Use the existing environment directly; activation is optional and you do not need to recreate it:

```powershell
Set-Location 'C:\Users\kshit\Documents\pothole_project'
.\.pothholevenv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.pothholevenv\Scripts\python.exe -m scripts.configure_django_secret
.\.pothholevenv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8003
```

Alternatively, activate the environment and use the shorter command:

```powershell
.\.pothholevenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8003
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, use the direct commands above; no execution-policy change is needed. You only need to install requirements on first setup or when they change. The signing-key command is safe to repeat: it preserves an existing key. See [Django lesson 5](docs/django-step-5.md).

Open http://127.0.0.1:8003 to see:

```json
{"message":"Django backend is running"}
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8003/health/ to see `{"status":"ok"}` and http://127.0.0.1:8003/health/database/ to see `{"status":"ok","database":"connected"}`. Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

The existing phone recording page still runs through the earlier FastAPI server at http://127.0.0.1:8001/capture. Start it separately with `.\.pothholevenv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001` if needed. Its [local HTTPS setup](docs/phone-https.md) is unchanged. See the [phone experiment guide](docs/phone-test.md). The web application has not been deployed.

## Understand the files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manage.py` | Runs Django commands such as `runserver`, `check` and `test`. |
| `backend/settings.py` | Django configuration, including the local PostgreSQL connection. |
| `backend/urls.py` | Connects URL paths to Django views. |
| `backend/views.py` | Returns JSON responses for the first two routes. |
| `backend/tests.py` | Checks the Django URL-to-view behavior. |
| `captures/models.py` | Defines a private journey's owner and start/end timestamps. |
| `captures/migrations/0001_initial.py` | Creates the capture-session table and its time-order constraint. |
| `captures/tests.py` | Checks valid and invalid recording intervals. |
| `captures/migrations/0002_gpsreading.py` | Creates the private GPS-reading table and its bounds checks. |
| `captures/serializers.py` | Validates API timestamps and exposes only session metadata. |
| `captures/views.py` | Lists a rider's sessions and assigns new sessions to that rider. |
| `backend/test_settings.py` | Uses an isolated SQLite database for API tests. |
| `app/main.py` | Earlier FastAPI server, kept during the phone-page transition. |
| `app/database.py` | Reads local connection settings and checks PostgreSQL with `SELECT 1`. |
| `scripts/configure_database.py` | Prompts for the application password locally, checks it, and saves the ignored `.env`. |
| `scripts/configure_django_secret.py` | Creates an ignored private Django signing key without printing it. |
| `.env.example` | Password-free reference for database settings. |
| `tests/test_database.py` | Checks configuration, password preservation, connection failures and endpoint responses. |
| `app/__init__.py` | Marks `app` as a Python package. |
| `app/static/capture.html` | Recording controls, camera preview, status and download links. |
| `app/static/capture.js` | Requests permissions, records video, timestamps locations and prepares downloads. |
| `app/static/capture.css` | Simple layout for laptop and phone screens. |
| `tests/capture-browser.cjs` | Browser checks with simulated devices; requires existing Node and Chrome. |
| `scripts/phone_https.py` | Prepares local certificates and starts the HTTPS phone test server. |
| `scripts/inspect_recording.py` | Summarizes recording timestamps, location gaps and accuracy estimates without printing coordinates. |
| `tests/test_inspect_recording.py` | Checks timing, malformed exports, file pairing and private output using synthetic fixtures. |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists the Python packages to install. |
| `.gitignore` | Keeps virtual environments, secrets, footage and model weights out of Git. |

`manage.py` loads the `backend.settings` Django configuration. `runserver` starts Django for local development. Port 8003 keeps it separate from the earlier FastAPI phone test on port 8001.

## GitHub checkpoints

Source repository: [flowbaka/Pothhole_Detection_Nepal](https://github.com/flowbaka/Pothhole_Detection_Nepal).

Git is initialized on `main`. Completed small milestones are committed and pushed to `origin` at the user's request. Review the changes and staged file list for each checkpoint. Record automated checks and actual phone results separately; a source push is not website deployment.

Virtual environments, certificates/private keys, private recordings/location exports, secrets and large model weights are excluded. Keep collected footage and journey files in the ignored `data/` folder.

From the project folder, inspect progress with:

```powershell
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

## Development order

1. Django backend foundation — request handling, PostgreSQL connection, private capture sessions and timestamped GPS readings verified.
2. Authenticated, owner-only session metadata API verified. Next add restricted uploads in Django/DRF, keeping footage and routes private.
3. Build and test an Android Expo collector for foreground video/GPS capture and upload after stopping. The existing iPhone browser test is separate feasibility evidence.
4. Collect and label the proposed local dataset, keeping held-out roads and journeys separate for evaluation.
5. Compare YOLO11n baseline with fine-tuned YOLO26n and YOLO26s; add tracking and video/GPS matching in a separate worker.
6. Model sightings, reviewed hazards, duplicate suggestions and review history. Measure location error and false merges.
7. Build the reviewer workflow, verified-only Leaflet/OpenStreetMap map and foreground Android audio alerts.
8. Validate the complete pipeline, timing and controlled user feedback; finish the dissertation.

Proceed one small backend lesson at a time. Frontend implementation is deferred; the 3D dashboard image is a design reference only. See the [proposal-aligned targets](docs/proposal-alignment.md) for the evaluation counts and current status.

## Scope and accuracy

Store each GPS reading's capture timestamp and accuracy, together with the recording start time. Upload-time location cannot locate an earlier journey. GPS initially locates the phone; a pothole ahead of the vehicle will have an additional offset. Reports must communicate approximate positioning and allow correction. An ordinary image alone does not establish pothole depth or physical severity.

Keep full journey traces private by default, and publish only verified hazards with the minimum needed information. Before public deployment add authentication, authorisation, secure uploads, HTTPS and appropriate privacy controls. These are future work, not protections implemented by this starter.
